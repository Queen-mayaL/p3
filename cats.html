        <p>
            Cats are independent but still need affection, playtime, and care.<br>
            They should be fed a balanced diet with a mix of wet and dry food, based on their age and health requirements.<br>
            Cats need their litter box cleaned regularly and access to fresh water at all times.<br>
            Regular grooming is important for long-haired breeds, and routine vet visits ensure they are healthy and up-to-date on vaccinations.<br>
            Cats love high places, so consider getting a cat tree for climbing and lounging.<br>
