        <p>
            Dogs require daily exercise, mental stimulation, and social interaction.<br>
            Itâ€™s important to feed them high-quality food suited to their age, breed, and activity level.<br>
            Regular vet visits for vaccinations, flea treatments, and check-ups are essential.<br>
            Dogs also need grooming depending on their coat type (e.g., brushing, nail trimming).<br>
            Always provide fresh water and ensure they have a safe, comfortable space to sleep.<br>
            Training and positive reinforcement are key to building a well-behaved dog.<br>
