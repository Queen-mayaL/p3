        <p>
            Fish require a clean, properly maintained aquarium.<br>
            The water temperature, pH, and hardness must be appropriate for the species you have.<br>
            Make sure to perform regular water changes to avoid toxic build-up. Fish also need a balanced diet that suits their speciesâ€”some are herbivores, while others are carnivores.<br>
            Avoid overfeeding, as excess food can pollute the water.<br>
            Regularly check the filter and water quality to maintain a healthy environment for your fish.<br>
